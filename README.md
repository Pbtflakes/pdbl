# pdbl: a tool for Turing machine simulation

Specifically intended for 𝒫″, the language developed by Corrado Böhm in 1964 to
describe a family of Turing machines. This language inspired an obfuscated
dialect titled "brainfuck," which includes two additional commands.

## Project scope
So what exactly is 𝒫″ anyways? Well, it's a language created by mathematician
Corrado Böhm in 1964 to describe ℬ″, a Turing machine with left-infinite tape.
